        <h1><i>foreword</i></h1>
        <p><i>Taizai</i> is an ongoing series of photos from my semester abroad in Japan.</p>
        <p>This collection is not meant to serve as a full travel log, <br> but to showcase the beauty I have found in some of my surroundings.</p>
        <p>That said, I have worked to balance shots of nice places I've visited<br> 
        amongst the slightly more experimental photos.</p>

        <p><i>Kyoto Wanderer</i> attempts to capture the sense of adventure <br> I felt during my early February trip,
        as well as offering a variety of scenes <br> from Kyoto's cityscape and its iconic temples.</p>

        <p><i>Spring Procession</i> is a collection of shots from the ephemeral cherry blossom season. <br>
        It also calls back to the notion of <i>seishun</i>, the springtime of youth, <br>
        as students start another year under the pink flowers.</p>

        <p><i>It Flies By</i> features photos taken during my trip to Tokyo during Golden Week. <br> Returning after four years,
        I visited places both new and old, <br> once again getting lost in the largest metropolitan area on the planet.</p>

        <p><i>Farewell Tour</i> marks the farthest out of my comfort zone I have gone <br> in terms of solo traveling.
        With less than two weeks left of my stay, I went down to Kochi <br> and made my way around some famous castles.</p>
